            <p> In order to keep as much material out of the landfill as possible, it’s important for each of us to do our part. 
            One of the ways to put that plan into action is through the 3 Rs of waste management — Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.  
            </p>

            <ol>
            <li>Reduce means to cut back on the amount of trash we generate.</li>
            <li>Reuse means to find new ways to use things that otherwise would have been thrown out.</li>
            <li>Recycle means to turn something old and useless (like plastic milk jugs) into something new and useful (like picnic benches, playground equipment and recycling bins).</li>
